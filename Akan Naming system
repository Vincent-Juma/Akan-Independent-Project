Naming system used in some countries to demonstrate their culture.
Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. A child’s name is determined by 
factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they were born may determine which name they get
irrespective of their gender. These Akan names signify the day one is born. According to Akan tradition, each child is born with a name associated 
to their soul. The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul. The well thought and organized naming system of the Akan’s was initiated 
by the ancestors and has attracted so many people’s attention as they desire to know more about these names. As a matter of fact, it is possible to tell
what led to someone’s birth, the day they were born and their rank among the siblings just by their names.
